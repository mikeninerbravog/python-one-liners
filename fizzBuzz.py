for i in range(1, 21): print("Fizz"*(i%3==0)+"Buzz"*(i%5==0) or str(i))

"""
This code is a concise way to print the numbers from 1 to 20, replacing numbers divisible by 3 with "Fizz" and numbers divisible by 5 with "Buzz" 
following the rules of the FizzBuzz game. Here's how it works:

1. `for i in range(1, 21)`: This is a `for` loop that iterates over the numbers from 1 to 20 (inclusive).

2. `print("Fizz"*(i%3==0)+"Buzz"*(i%5==0) or str(i))`: This line prints the appropriate output for each number `i` based on the FizzBuzz rules.

   - `"Fizz"*(i%3==0)`: This part of the line checks if `i` is divisible by 3 (i.e., if `i % 3` equals 0). If it is divisible by 3, it produces 
   the string "Fizz"; otherwise, it produces an empty string.
   - `"Buzz"*(i%5==0)`: This part checks if `i` is divisible by 5 (i.e., if `i % 5` equals 0). If it is divisible by 5, it produces the string "Buzz"; 
   otherwise, it produces an empty string.
   - `or str(i)`: If both of the above conditions are not met (i.e., if `i` is neither divisible by 3 nor by 5), it converts the number `i` 
   to a string using `str(i)`.

So, the line combines "Fizz" and "Buzz" if the number is divisible by 3 and 5 (for example, "FizzBuzz" for 15), and it prints the number itself 
as a string for all other cases.

The output of this code will be the FizzBuzz sequence for the numbers from 1 to 20:

```
1
2
Fizz
4
Buzz
Fizz
7
8
Fizz
Buzz
11
Fizz
13
14
FizzBuzz
16
17
Fizz
19
Buzz
```
