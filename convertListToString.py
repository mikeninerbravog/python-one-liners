"""
This code snippet creates a list `l` containing a mix of strings and an integer and then converts the elements in the list 
to strings before joining them together into a single string. Here's a breakdown of the code:

1. `l = ["Welcome", 2, "BRAVOG"]`: This line defines a list `l` that contains three elements:
   - The string `"Welcome"`.
   - The integer `2`.
   - The string `"BRAVOG"`.

2. `[str(elem) for elem in l]`: This is a list comprehension that iterates over each element `elem` in 
the list `l` and converts each element to a string using the `str()` function. It creates a new list 
containing all the elements as strings. So, it will look like `["Welcome", "2", "BRAVOG"]`.

3. `' '.join(...)`: The `join()` method is used on a string to join the elements of an iterable 
(in this case, a list) into a single string. Here, it joins the elements of the list created in step 2 using a space character as the separator.

4. `print(s)`: Finally, the resulting string `s`, which is the elements of the list joined together with spaces, is printed to the console.

The output of this code will be:

```
Welcome 2 BRAVOG
```

All the elements in the list have been converted to strings and joined together with spaces in the output string.
