import datetime; print(datetime.datetime.now().strftime("%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S"))

"""
This code snippet uses the `datetime` module in Python to print the current date and time in a specific format. Here's a breakdown of the code:

1. `import datetime`: This line imports the `datetime` module, which provides classes for working with dates and times in Python.

2. `datetime.datetime.now()`: This part of the code calls the `now()` method of the `datetime` module, 
which returns the current date and time as a `datetime` object.

3. `.strftime("%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S")`: The `strftime()` method is called on the `datetime` object. 

It allows you to format the date and time as a string according to a specified format. In this case, the format is `"%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S"`, which stands for:
   - `%Y`: Year with century as a decimal number (e.g., 2023).
   - `%m`: Month as a zero-padded decimal number (e.g., 01 for January).
   - `%d`: Day of the month as a zero-padded decimal number (e.g., 07 for the 7th day).
   - `%H`: Hour (24-hour clock) as a zero-padded decimal number (e.g., 14 for 2:00 PM).
   - `%M`: Minute as a zero-padded decimal number (e.g., 05).
   - `%S`: Second as a zero-padded decimal number (e.g., 09).

4. `print(...)`: Finally, the formatted date and time string is printed to the console.

The output of this code will be the current date and time in the specified format, for example:

```
2023-11-08 14:05:09
```

The exact date and time will vary depending on when you run the code.
