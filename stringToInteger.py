"""
This code snippet converts strings representing numbers into their integer (int) representations using the `int()` function. Here's a breakdown of the code:

1. `str1 = '0'`: This line defines a string variable `str1` with the value `'0'`, which represents the number zero.

2. `str2 = '100'`: This line defines another string variable `str2` with the value `'100'`, which represents the number one hundred.

3. `str3 = '587'`: This line defines a third string variable `str3` with the value `'587'`, which represents the number five hundred eighty-seven.

4. `print(int(str1))`: This line converts the string `str1` to an integer using the `int()` function and then prints the result. Since `str1` 
represents zero, it will print `0`.

5. `print(int(str2))`: This line converts the string `str2` to an integer and prints the result. `str2` represents one hundred, so it will print `100`.

6. `print(int(str3))`: Similarly, this line converts the string `str3` to an integer and prints the result. `str3` 
represents five hundred eighty-seven, so it will print `587`.

The `int()` function is used to convert a string containing a numeric representation into an integer, making it suitable for mathematical operations.
