"""
This code demonstrates how to reverse a list in Python using the `reverse()` method. Here's a breakdown of the code:

1. `arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]`: This line defines a list `arr` containing a sequence of integers.

2. `print(arr)`: This line prints the original list `arr` to the console.

3. `arr.reverse()`: This line reverses the order of elements in the list `arr` in place using the `reverse()` method.

4. `print(arr)`: This line prints the list `arr` after it has been reversed.

The output of this code will be:

```
[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
[6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1]
```

As you can see, the original list is printed, and then the `reverse()` method is used to reverse the order of the elements in the list, 
resulting in the reversed list being printed.
